- 👋 Hi, I’m John (@Moyo75) -  a frontend developer, blogger and content creator.
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and frameworks (mainly React).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects to deepen my knowledge in React and at the same time to build my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m open to roles as a frontend developer and your can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AdemoyeJohn).
