- 👋 Hi, I’m John (@Moyo75) -  a frontend developer, blogger and content creator.
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and frameworks (mainly React).
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects to deepen my knowledge in React and at the same time to build my portfolio.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects. I've made about three attempts and it seems this third one might just be different. I found a project which might be a good place to start.
- 📫 How to reach me easily on Twitter. I'm active there, sharing content and engaging people.
